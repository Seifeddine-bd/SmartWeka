# SmartWeka

SmartWeka is a user-friendly data analysis application built in Java that leverages the capabilities of Weka for machine learning. The application allows users to load datasets, select algorithms, and visualize analysis results, making advanced data analytics accessible to everyone.

## Features

- **Load Datasets**: Supports ARFF and CSV formats.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose from various machine learning algorithms, including:
  - J48 (Decision Tree)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - K-Means Clustering
  - DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)
  - CAH (Hierarchical Clustering)
- **Results Visualization**: Display analysis results in a user-friendly interface.
- **Save Results**: Easily save analysis outcomes for future reference.
- **Version Control**: Developed using Git for efficient collaboration and version management.
